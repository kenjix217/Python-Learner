## 🔧 **Implementation Approach**

**Following all MDs:**

**1. Content Creation:**
- 6-step structure (`AI_TUTOR_RULES.md`)
- Code-in-blocks format
- Progressive difficulty
- Real-world examples
- Tested with Pyodide (where applicable)

**2. Homework Validation:**
- Test cases for each lesson
- Pattern-based checking
- Educational hints
- Mastery gates

**3. Library Usage:**
- Only free/open-source libraries
- Verify licenses (MIT, Apache, BSD)
- Document in `FREE_TOOLS_AND_LICENSING.md`
- No credit card requirements

**4. Web-First Constraint:**
- Lessons teach concepts
- Code examples run in Pyodide (where possible)
- External deployments noted as optional
- Focus on transferable skills

## 📋 **Libraries to Teach (All Free)**

**Data & Web:**
- requests (MIT) - HTTP requests ✅
- Flask (BSD) - Web framework ✅
- pandas (BSD) - Data analysis ✅
- numpy (BSD) - Numerical computing ✅

**Visualization:**
- matplotlib (PSF) - Plotting ✅
- plotly (MIT) - Interactive charts ✅

**Database:**
- SQLite (Public Domain) - Built-in ✅
- SQLAlchemy (MIT) - ORM ✅

**Testing:**
- pytest (MIT) - Testing framework ✅
- unittest (Python std lib) - Built-in ✅

**Automation:**
- schedule (MIT) - Job scheduling ✅
- beautifulsoup4 (MIT) - Web scraping ✅

**All verified free/open-source!** ✅

---

## ⚠️ **Pyodide Limitations**

**What works in browser:**
- ✅ All Python standard library
- ✅ Pure Python packages
- ✅ Some data science (numpy, pandas available in Pyodide)
- ❌ Network requests (limited/blocked by CORS)
- ❌ File system access (virtual only)
- ❌ Some C-extension packages

**Teaching Strategy:**
- Teach concepts with Pyodide examples
- Note external deployment for full features
- Focus on transferable knowledge

## 🚀 **Start Implementation?**

**I can begin with:**

**Lesson 11: Working with External Libraries**
- Virtual environments
- pip and package installation  
- Importing libraries
- requests library example
- **Homework:** Use requests to get data from free API

**Then continue through Lessons 12-22!**

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours for all 12 lessons

**Shall I proceed with Lesson 11?** 📚🚀

This will make the platform a **complete Python education from zero to employment-ready!**

- Automation and testing
- Deployment to production
- **Professional development skills!**

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Install Real Python**

**Why:**
- Lessons 1-10 ran in your browser (Pyodide)
- Lessons 11-22 need real Python on your computer
- Advanced features require external libraries

**What to do:**
1. **Read:** `INSTALL_REAL_PYTHON.md` (complete guide)
2. **Download:** Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. **Install:** Follow guide (10-15 minutes)
4. **Verify:** Run `python --version` in terminal
5. **Continue:** Start Lesson 11!

---

## 📝 **Installation Checklist**

**Before starting Lesson 11, make sure you have:**
- [ ] Python 3.9+ installed
- [ ] pip working (`pip --version`)
- [ ] Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- [ ] Can run Python scripts from terminal
- [ ] Understand virtual environments (venv)

**All checked?** ✅ **You're ready for advanced lessons!**

## 🎯 **Two Paths Forward**

### **Path A: Continue in Browser (Limited)**
- You can READ Lessons 11-22
- Learn the concepts
- Understand the code
- **BUT:** Can't install libraries or run all examples

### **Path B: Install Real Python (Recommended)**
- READ and PRACTICE Lessons 11-22
- Install libraries (pip install)
- Build real web apps
- Deploy to production
- **Full professional experience!**

**We strongly recommend Path B!** 🌟

# What is Programming?

## Goal

By the end of this lesson, you will understand what programming is, why it is useful, and why Python is a great first language to learn.

---

## Explanation

Programming is giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks. Just like you might follow a recipe to bake a cake, a computer follows a program to complete a task.

Think of it this way: when you tell a friend how to get to your house, you give them step-by-step directions. Programming is the same idea, except you are talking to a computer instead of a person.

**Why do we program?**

Computers are very fast and very precise. They can do repetitive tasks without getting tired or making mistakes. But they are not smart on their own. They need clear, exact instructions. That is what a program is—a set of instructions written in a language the computer understands.

**Why Python?**

Python is one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages. It reads almost like plain English. You can write powerful programs with just a few lines of code. It is used everywhere: websites, data science, games, and even robots.

Here is what makes Python special:

- Easy to read and write
- Used by professionals in many fields
- A huge community ready to help beginners
- Free and works on any computer

## Example

Here is a very simple Python program:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

**What this does:**

This program displays the message "Hello, world!" on the screen.

**Let's break it down:**

- print() is a command that tells Python to show something on the screen
- The text inside the parentheses and quotes is what will be displayed
- When you run this program, Python shows:

```
Hello, world!
```

That is it. You just saw a complete Python program.

## Guided Practice

Now it is your turn to try. Follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Go to the **Practice** tab at the top of this page.

**Step 2:** In the code editor, type the following:

```python
print("I am learning Python!")
```

**Step 3:** Click the **Run Code** button.

**Step 4:** Look at the output area below the editor. You should see:

```
I am learning Python!
```

**Step 5:** Try changing the message inside the quotes to something else, like your name or a favorite hobby. Run it again and see what happens.

You have just written and run your first Python program. Notice how Python immediately does what you told it to do.

<h3>🌍 Python In The Wild</h3>
<p>Where is this actually used?</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>NASA:</strong> Uses Python to analyze data from space telescopes.</li>
    <li><strong>Netflix:</strong> Uses Python to recommend movies you might like.</li>
    <li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Built largely on Python to handle millions of photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code you are learning today is the same language used by these giants!</p>

<div class="fix-this-challenge">
<h3>🛠️ Challenge: Fix This Code!</h3>
<p>The code below is broken. Can you spot the error and fix it in the Practice tab?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("This works fine")
print("But this is broken"
print("And this is ignored")</code></pre>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Look closely at the second line. What is missing at the end?</p>
</div>

## Homework

Your task is to write a program that displays **three lines of text**.

Each line should say something about you. For example:

```
My name is Alex.
I am learning to code.
I want to build apps.
```

**Requirements:**

- Use the print() command
- Display exactly three lines
- Each line should be a complete sentence about you

**Hints:**

You will need to use print() three times:

```python
print("First sentence")
print("Second sentence")
print("Third sentence")
```

Each print() command goes on its own line.

Remember to put your text inside quotes.

Do not look for the solution online. Try it yourself. If you get stuck, think about the example you just saw. You can do this.

## Reflection

Before moving to the next lesson, think about these questions:

1. What is programming?
2. Why do computers need instructions?
3. What does the `print()` command do?
4. Why is Python a good language for beginners?

If you can answer these questions in your own words, you are ready to continue.

**Great work!** You have taken your first step into programming. When you are ready, move on to Lesson 2.
